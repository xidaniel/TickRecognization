<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->



## Contributing

- Proposed a Lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model and developed an Android Application with a dynamic UI to display detection results, inference time, and image information utilizing Python, Java, and Android studio.
- Developed a classifier class to preprocess image, recognize images, and get the top K results utilizing TensorFlow Lite APIs.
- Cooperated with the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ) to collect more than 27,000 unique images and utilized Python and OpenCV to preprocess them by image cleaning, automatic object cutting, images category, etc.
- Addressed overfitting applying regularization with optimal parameters, dropout, and data augmentation utilizing Keras.
- Trained the model on a cloud server to achieve 95% accuracy with an inference speed of 200ms/image on a mobile phone device.
